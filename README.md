This module creates an S3 bucket with support for versioning, lifecycles, object locks, replication, encryption, ACL,
bucket object policies, and static website hosting.

For backward compatibility, it sets the S3 bucket ACL to `private` and the `s3_object_ownership`
to `ObjectWriter`. Moving forward, setting `s3_object_ownership` to `BucketOwnerEnforced` is recommended,
and doing so automatically disables the ACL.

This module blocks public access to the bucket by default. See `block_public_acls`, `block_public_policy`,
`ignore_public_acls`, and `restrict_public_buckets` to change the settings. See [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html)
for more details.  

This module can optionally create an IAM User with access to the S3 bucket. This is inherently insecure in that
to enable anyone to become the User, access keys must be generated, and anything generated by Terraform is stored
unencrypted in the Terraform state. See the [Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/sensitive-data.html) for more details

The best way to grant access to the bucket is to grant one or more IAM Roles access to the bucket via `privileged_principal_arns`.
This IAM Role can be assumed by EC2 instances via their Instance Profile, or Kubernetes (EKS) services using
[IRSA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html).
Entities outside of AWS can assume the Role via [OIDC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html). 
(See [this example of connecting GitHub](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/use-iam-roles-to-connect-github-actions-to-actions-in-aws/)
to enable GitHub actions to assume AWS IAM roles, or use [this Cloud Posse component](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/tree/main/modules/github-oidc-provider)
if you are already using the Cloud Posse reference architecture.)

If neither of those approaches work, then as a last resort you can set `user_enabled = true` and
this module will provision a basic IAM user with permissions to access the bucket.
We do not recommend creating IAM users this way for any other purpose.

If an IAM user is created, the IAM user name is constructed using [terraform-null-label](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label)
and some input is required. The simplest input is `name`. By default the name will be converted to lower case
and all non-alphanumeric characters except for hyphen will be removed. See the documentation for `terraform-null-label`
to learn how to override these defaults if desired.

If an AWS Access Key is created, it is stored either in SSM Parameter Store or is provided as a module output,
but not both. Using SSM Parameter Store is recommended because that will keep the secret from being easily accessible
via Terraform remote state lookup, but the key will still be stored unencrypted in the Terraform state in any case.

## Usage

Using [BucketOwnerEnforced](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html#object-ownership-overview)

```hcl
module "s3_bucket" {
  source = "cloudposse/s3-bucket/aws"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version = "x.x.x"
  name                     = "app"
  stage                    = "test"
  namespace                = "eg"

  s3_object_ownership      = "BucketOwnerEnforced"
  enabled                  = true
  user_enabled             = false
  versioning_enabled       = false

  privileged_principal_actions   = ["s3:GetObject", "s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetBucketLocation"]
  privileged_principal_arns      = [
    {
      (local.deployment_iam_role_arn) = [""]
    },
    {
      (local.additional_deployment_iam_role_arn) = ["prefix1/", "prefix2/"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Configuring S3 [storage lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html):

```hcl
locals {
  lifecycle_configuration_rules = [{
    enabled = true # bool
    id      = "v2rule"

    abort_incomplete_multipart_upload_days = 1 # number

    filter_and = null
    expiration = {
      days = 120 # integer > 0
    }
    noncurrent_version_expiration = {
      newer_noncurrent_versions = 3  # integer > 0
      noncurrent_days           = 60 # integer >= 0
    }
    transition = [{
      days          = 30            # integer >= 0
      storage_class = "STANDARD_IA" # string/enum, one of GLACIER, STANDARD_IA, ONEZONE_IA, INTELLIGENT_TIERING, DEEP_ARCHIVE, GLACIER_IR.
      },
      {
        days          = 60           # integer >= 0
        storage_class = "ONEZONE_IA" # string/enum, one of GLACIER, STANDARD_IA, ONEZONE_IA, INTELLIGENT_TIERING, DEEP_ARCHIVE, GLACIER_IR.
    }]
    noncurrent_version_transition = [{
      newer_noncurrent_versions = 3            # integer >= 0
      noncurrent_days           = 30           # integer >= 0
      storage_class             = "ONEZONE_IA" # string/enum, one of GLACIER, STANDARD_IA, ONEZONE_IA, INTELLIGENT_TIERING, DEEP_ARCHIVE, GLACIER_IR.
    }]
  }]
}
```


Allowing specific principal ARNs to perform actions on the bucket:

```hcl
module "s3_bucket" {
  source = "cloudposse/s3-bucket/aws"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version = "x.x.x"
  s3_object_ownership      = "BucketOwnerEnforced"
  enabled                  = true
  user_enabled             = true
  versioning_enabled       = false
  allowed_bucket_actions   = ["s3:GetObject", "s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetBucketLocation"]
  name                     = "app"
  stage                    = "test"
  namespace                = "eg"

  privileged_principal_arns = [
  {
    "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/principal1" = ["prefix1/", "prefix2/"]
  }, {
    "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/principal2" = [""]
  }]
  privileged_principal_actions = [
    "s3:PutObject", 
    "s3:PutObjectAcl", 
    "s3:GetObject", 
    "s3:DeleteObject", 
    "s3:ListBucket", 
    "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads", 
    "s3:GetBucketLocation", 
    "s3:AbortMultipartUpload"
  ]
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.
