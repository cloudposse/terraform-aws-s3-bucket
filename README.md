# terraform-aws-s3-bucket [![Codefresh Build Status](https://g.codefresh.io/api/badges/pipeline/cloudposse/terraform-modules%2Fterraform-aws-s3-bucket?type=cf-1)](https://g.codefresh.io/public/accounts/cloudposse/pipelines/5d13993639efa9451b1a2aa4) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-bucket.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-bucket/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


This module creates an S3 bucket with support of versioning, encryption, ACL and bucket object policy.
If `user_enabled` variable is set to `true`, the module will provision a basic IAM user with permissions to access the bucket.

This basic IAM system user is suitable for CI/CD systems (_e.g._ TravisCI, CircleCI) or systems which are *external* to AWS that cannot leverage [AWS IAM Instance Profiles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html).

We do not recommend creating IAM users this way for any other purpose.

[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-bucket/releases).


```hcl
module "s3_bucket" {
  source                   = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-bucket.git?ref=master"
  enabled                  = true
  user_enabled             = true
  versioning_enabled       = false
  allowed_bucket_actions   = ["s3:GetObject", "s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetBucketLocation"]
  name                     = "app"
  stage                    = "test"
  namespace                = "eg"
}
```

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| acl | The canned ACL to apply. We recommend `private` to avoid exposing sensitive information | string | `private` | no |
| allow_encrypted_uploads_only | Set to `true` to prevent uploads of unencrypted objects to S3 bucket | bool | `false` | no |
| allowed_bucket_actions | List of actions the user is permitted to perform on the S3 bucket | list(string) | `<list>` | no |
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `1`) | list(string) | `<list>` | no |
| delimiter | Delimiter to be used between `namespace`, `environment`, `stage`, `name` and `attributes` | string | `-` | no |
| enabled | Set to false to prevent the module from creating any resources | bool | `true` | no |
| environment | Environment, e.g. 'prod', 'staging', 'dev', 'pre-prod', 'UAT' | string | `` | no |
| force_destroy | A boolean string that indicates all objects should be deleted from the bucket so that the bucket can be destroyed without error. These objects are not recoverable | bool | `false` | no |
| kms_master_key_arn | The AWS KMS master key ARN used for the `SSE-KMS` encryption. This can only be used when you set the value of `sse_algorithm` as `aws:kms`. The default aws/s3 AWS KMS master key is used if this element is absent while the `sse_algorithm` is `aws:kms` | string | `` | no |
| lifecycle_rule_enabled | Enable or disable lifecycle rule | bool | `false` | no |
| name | Solution name, e.g. 'app' or 'jenkins' | string | `` | no |
| namespace | Namespace, which could be your organization name or abbreviation, e.g. 'eg' or 'cp' | string | `` | no |
| noncurrent_version_expiration_days | Specifies when noncurrent object versions expire | number | `90` | no |
| noncurrent_version_transition_days | Number of days to persist in the standard storage tier before moving to the glacier tier infrequent access tier | number | `30` | no |
| policy | A valid bucket policy JSON document. Note that if the policy document is not specific enough (but still valid), Terraform may view the policy as constantly changing in a terraform plan. In this case, please make sure you use the verbose/specific version of the policy | string | `` | no |
| prefix | Prefix identifying one or more objects to which the rule applies | string | `` | no |
| region | If specified, the AWS region this bucket should reside in. Otherwise, the region used by the callee | string | `` | no |
| sse_algorithm | The server-side encryption algorithm to use. Valid values are `AES256` and `aws:kms` | string | `AES256` | no |
| stage | Stage, e.g. 'prod', 'staging', 'dev', OR 'source', 'build', 'test', 'deploy', 'release' | string | `` | no |
| tags | Additional tags (e.g. `map('BusinessUnit','XYZ')` | map(string) | `<map>` | no |
| user_enabled | Set to `true` to create an IAM user with permission to access the bucket | bool | `false` | no |
| versioning_enabled | A state of versioning. Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket | bool | `false` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| access_key_id | The access key ID |
| bucket_arn | Bucket ARN |
| bucket_domain_name | FQDN of bucket |
| bucket_id | Bucket Name (aka ID) |
| enabled | Is module enabled |
| secret_access_key | The secret access key. This will be written to the state file in plain-text |
| user_arn | The ARN assigned by AWS for the user |
| user_enabled | Is user creation enabled |
| user_name | Normalized IAM user name |
| user_unique_id | The user unique ID assigned by AWS |
