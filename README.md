This module creates an S3 bucket with support of versioning, encryption, ACL and bucket object policy.
If `user_enabled` variable is set to `true`, the module will provision a basic IAM user with permissions to access the bucket.

This basic IAM system user is suitable for CI/CD systems (_e.g._ TravisCI, CircleCI) or systems which are *external* to AWS that cannot leverage [AWS IAM Instance Profiles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html).

We do not recommend creating IAM users this way for any other purpose.

It blocks public access to the bucket by default.

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-bucket/releases).


Using a [canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html).

```hcl
module "s3_bucket" {
  source                   = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-bucket.git?ref=master"
  acl                      = "private"
  enabled                  = true
  user_enabled             = true
  versioning_enabled       = false
  allowed_bucket_actions   = ["s3:GetObject", "s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetBucketLocation"]
  name                     = "app"
  stage                    = "test"
  namespace                = "eg"
}
```

Using [grants](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html) to enable access to another account and for logging.

```hcl
module "s3_bucket" {
  source                   = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-bucket.git?ref=master"
  acl                      = ""
  enabled                  = true
  user_enabled             = true
  versioning_enabled       = false
  allowed_bucket_actions   = ["s3:GetObject", "s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetBucketLocation"]
  name                     = "app"
  stage                    = "test"
  namespace                = "eg"

  grants = [
    {
      id          = "012abc345def678ghi901" # Canonical user or account id
      type        = "CanonicalUser"
      permissions = ["FULL_CONTROL"]
      uri         = null
    },
    {
      id          = null
      type        = "Group"
      permissions = ["READ", "WRITE"]
      uri         = "http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery"
    },
  ]
}
