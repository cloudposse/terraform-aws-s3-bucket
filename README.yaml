# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This module creates an S3 bucket with support of versioning, encryption, ACL and bucket object policy.
  If `user_enabled` variable is set to `true`, the module will provision a basic IAM user with permissions to access the bucket.

  This basic IAM system user is suitable for CI/CD systems (_e.g._ TravisCI, CircleCI) or systems which are *external* to AWS that cannot leverage [AWS IAM Instance Profiles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html).

  We do not recommend creating IAM users this way for any other purpose.

  It blocks public access to the bucket by default.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  Using a [canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html).

  ```hcl
  module "s3_bucket" {
    source                   = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-bucket.git?ref=master"
    acl                      = "private"
    enabled                  = true
    user_enabled             = true
    versioning_enabled       = false
    allowed_bucket_actions   = ["s3:GetObject", "s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetBucketLocation"]
    name                     = "app"
    stage                    = "test"
    namespace                = "eg"
  }
  ```

  Using [grants](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html) to enable access to another account and for logging.

  ```hcl
  module "s3_bucket" {
    source                   = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-bucket.git?ref=master"
    acl                      = ""
    enabled                  = true
    user_enabled             = true
    versioning_enabled       = false
    allowed_bucket_actions   = ["s3:GetObject", "s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetBucketLocation"]
    name                     = "app"
    stage                    = "test"
    namespace                = "eg"

    grants = [
      {
        id          = "012abc345def678ghi901" # Canonical user or account id
        type        = "CanonicalUser"
        permissions = ["FULL_CONTROL"]
        uri         = null
      },
      {
        id          = null
        type        = "Group"
        permissions = ["READ", "WRITE"]
        uri         = "http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery"
      },
    ]
  }
  ```
